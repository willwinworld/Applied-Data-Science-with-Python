# # Assignment 4 - Document Similarity & Topic Modelling

# ## Part 1 - Document Similarity
# 
# For the first part of this assignment, you will complete the functions `doc_to_synsets` and `similarity_score` which will be used by `document_path_similarity` to find the path similarity between two documents.
# 
# The following functions are provided:
# * **`convert_tag:`** converts the tag given by `nltk.pos_tag` to a tag used by `wordnet.synsets`. You will need to use this function in `doc_to_synsets`.
# * **`document_path_similarity:`** computes the symmetrical path similarity between two documents by finding the synsets in each document using `doc_to_synsets`, then computing similarities using `similarity_score`.
# 
# You will need to finish writing the following functions:
# * **`doc_to_synsets:`** returns a list of synsets in document. This function should first tokenize and part of speech tag the document using `nltk.word_tokenize` and `nltk.pos_tag`. Then it should find each tokens corresponding synset using `wn.synsets(token, wordnet_tag)`. The first synset match should be used. If there is no match, that token is skipped.
# * **`similarity_score:`** returns the normalized similarity score of a list of synsets (s1) onto a second list of synsets (s2). For each synset in s1, find the synset in s2 with the largest similarity value. Sum all of the largest similarity values together and normalize this value by dividing it by the number of largest similarity values found. Be careful with data types, which should be floats. Missing values should be ignored.
# 
# Once `doc_to_synsets` and `similarity_score` have been completed, submit to the autograder which will run `test_document_path_similarity` to test that these functions are running correctly. 
# 
# *Do not modify the functions `convert_tag`, `document_path_similarity`, and `test_document_path_similarity`.*

# ## Part 2 - Topic Modelling
# 
# For the second part of this assignment, you will use Gensim's LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to model topics in `newsgroup_data`. You will first need to finish the code in the cell below by using gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel constructor to estimate LDA model parameters on the corpus, and save to the variable `ldamodel`. Extract 10 topics using `corpus` and `id_map`, and with `passes=25` and `random_state=34`.

# remove tokens that don't appear in at least 20 documents,
# remove tokens that appear in more than 20% of the documents

# ### lda_topics
# 
# Using `ldamodel`, find a list of the 10 topics and the most significant 10 words in each topic. This should be structured as a list of 10 tuples where each tuple takes on the form:
